=== Enhancement Added: Edit Meeting


==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=editmeeting]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Addition of the `editmeeting` command allows the changing of details a `Meeting` object created by the user when required. For
example the location of a set meeting might be changed after the creation of the meeting and hence the `editmeeting` command would
be required to reflect this change in ScheduBook.

=== Enhancement Added: Find Exact Meeting


==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=findexactmeeting]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The implementation of `findexactmeeting` allows users to narrow down their search results as compared
to when using the `findmeeting` command as the conditions for a meeting to match the search results
are more strict.
